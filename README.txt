Features that Shipengine integration for Dokan Multivendor with WooCommerce plugin provides:
1. Checks for the shipping quote from all different shipping connections you've added to ShipEngine.
2. Uses the Vendor's store address as the source address and the Customer's address as the destination in quotes and label.
3. Shows the shipping rate and adds to the total, after the tax.
4. After checkout, shipping labels get created from ShipEngine API.
5. A label is then sent out to the vendor's email with the order email.
6. The customer gets a tracking number and link in their own order email as well.
What you will need to use the plugin:
1. WooCommerce.
2. Dokan plugin to create Multivendor platform.
3. Shipping classes to be added with dimensions and max possible weight.
4. Verified ShipEngine account.
5. Shipping carriers' connections in the ShipEngine platform.
Few considerations while using the plugin:
1. The plugin depends on Shipping classes. If you miss a dimension or weight, the quotes will have no or unreal results.
2. There is no dev or sandbox mode yet in the first version of this plugin. Everything happens in production.
3. Your ShipEngine account should be in good standing.
4. We recommend having carts to only allow products to be purchased from one vendor in one order. There is a setting in Dokan that you can activate. Multiple vendors in one cart have not been added yet in this version.
This is a free plugin from https://wpspins.com. No Strings attached. We would never pull any information from your WordPress site and won't show annoying popups or notices.
